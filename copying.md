If you wish to include a file from libtwitch-rs in your project, make sure to
include all required legal info. The easiest way to do this would probably
be to include a copy of this file (`copying.md`), and to leave the file's
copyright header untouched.

Per-file license header guidelines:

In addition to this file, to prevent legal caveats, every source file *must*
include a header.

**libtwitch-rs-native** source files, that is, files that were created by
_the libtwitch-rs authors_, require the following one-line header, preferably in
the first line, as a comment:

    Copyright 20XX-20YY the libtwitch-rs authors. See copying.md for legal info.

`20XX` is the year when the file was created, and `20YY` is the year when the
file was last edited. When editing a file, make sure the last-modification year
is still correct.

**3rd-party** source files, that is, files that were taken from other open-
source projects, require the following, longer header:

    This file was ((taken|adapted)|contains (data|code)) from $PROJECT,
    Copyright 1337-2013 copyright owners name.
    It's licensed under the terms of the 3-clause BSD license.
    < any amount of lines of further legal information required by $PROJECT,
      such as a reference to a copy of the $PROJECT's README or AUTHORS file >
    < if third-party files from more than the one project were used in this
      file, copy the above any number of times >
    (Modifications|Other (data|code)|Everything else) Copyright 2014-2014 the libtwitch-rs authors.
    See copying.md for further legal info.

In addition to the libtwitch-rs header, the file's original license header should
be retained if in doubt.

The "license" line is required only if the file is not licensed as
"AGPLv3 or higher".

Authors of 3rd-party files should generally not be entered in the
"libtwitch-rs authors" list.

All 3rd-party files **must** be included in the following list.
